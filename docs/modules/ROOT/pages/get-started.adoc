= Get Started with Hazelcast JDBC Driver
:url-dbeaver-jdbc: https://dbeaver.com/docs/wiki/Database-drivers/
:description: This guide explains how to set up and configure the JDBC driver to connect to a local Hazelcast cluster using any JDBC-compliant application framework, library, or tool. It also shows you a simple way to test your connection.

{description}

This guide does not attempt to provide step-by-step instructions for the configuration of individual products but does include some examples for integrating the JDBC driver with Spring Boot and DBeaver.

== Before You Begin

To follow this guide, you need the following:

|===
|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|A Hazelcast cluster in client/server mode running on your local network.
|xref:getting-started:get-started-binary.adoc[Start a Local Cluster].
|===

== Step 1. Install the JDBC Driver

To get started, do one of the following:

- Download the JDBC driver manually. Either copy the `hazelcast-jdbc.jar` to the correct directory on your local machine (as described in the documentation for the tool you want to integrate). Or, if you intend to use a programming interface, such as Spring Boot, set your classpath to the directory where you put the JAR file.
- Download the JDBC driver using Maven. Simply add the `hazelcast-jdbc` dependency to the `pom.xml` of the application framework that you want to integrate.

+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>{full-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Whichever installation method you choose, the `com.hazelcast.jdbc.Driver` class is automatically registered so you don't need to do this.

== Step 2. Loading the JDBC Driver

Next, you need to load the JDBC driver by adding the JDBC driver class name `com.hazelcast.jdbc.Driver` to your client application or preferred tool.

For example, for a client application written in Spring Boot, you can add the following to your `application.properties` file.

[source,bash]
----
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.hazelcast.jdbc.Driver
----

Or, if you're using a tool like DBeaver, add the class name to your link:{url-dbeaver-jdbc}[driver configuration].

== Step 3. Connecting to the Cluster

When the JDBC driver is loaded, the connection URL gives the driver a way to identify and connect to your Hazelcast cluster. 

Add the following connection URL to your client application or preferred tool.

[source,bash]
----
jdbc:hazelcast://localhost:5701/?clusterName=hello-world
----

For a client application written in Sprint Boot, you can add the connection URL to your `application.properties` file.

[source,bash]
----
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hazelcast:/localhost:5701/?clusterName=hello-world
----

If you're using DBeaver, add the connection URL to your database connection settings.

NOTE: Other xref:configuration.adoc#connection-prop[connection properties] are also available.

== Step 4. Testing Your Connection

In this step, you'll start your application and test the connection to your Hazelcast cluster by querying some test data on it. Begin by writing some test data to your cluster.

. Start your local Hazelcast cluster.

. Start Management Center for your cluster.

====

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080. 
+
Your cluster details are displayed.

. Click *View Cluster* and then select *SQL Browser* from the top navigation.

. Execute the following SQL to create a table on the cluster for some test data.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING people (
__key INT, 
age INT, 
name VARCHAR)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');
----
. Execute the following SQL to insert some test data.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO people VALUES
(1, 23,'John'),
(2, 35, 'Mary'),
(3, 15, 'Amber'),
(4, 68, 'Matthew'),
(5, 45, 'Carol'),
(6, 45, 'Carolyn');
----

Now you're ready to start up and test your preferred tool or framework. The following example shows how to test a connection to a Hazelcast cluster and query the data on it using DBeaver.

. Select the database connection to your Hazelcast cluster and click **Edit**.
+
image::ROOT:dbconnection.png[DBeaver database connection]

. Click **Test Connection**.
+
DBeaver displays a message to confirm your connnection to the cluster.

. To make sure that you can access data on the cluster, select **SQL Editor** > **Open SQL Console** and execute the following query.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM people;
----
DBeaver returns all entries that you added to the `people` map.
